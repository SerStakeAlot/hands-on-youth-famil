# Owner Portrait Drop Zone

Place the transparent cut-out photo of the Hands On Youth & Family Project Owner in this folder.

**How it works**

- Save the file using any common web image format (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, or `.svg`).
- You can keep the original filename; the site automatically loads the first supported image it finds in this folder at build time.
- If you update or replace the image, just drop the new version here and refresh/rebuild—no code changes needed.

> Tip: A transparent `.png` with trimmed whitespace will blend best with the artistic frame on the Home page.
