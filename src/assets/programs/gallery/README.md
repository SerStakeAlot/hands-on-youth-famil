# Gallery belt assets

Drop up to ~15 photos (PNG/JPG/JPEG/WEBP/SVG) in this folder.
The Programs page will automatically create a looping conveyor belt.
File order follows natural sort; rename if you want a different sequence.

Recommendations:
- Similar aspect ratios (e.g. 4:3 or 3:2) for consistent height
- Keep each file reasonably small (<300KB) for smooth animation
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g. `family-workshop-01.jpg`)

Remove any you do not want shown and refresh the dev server.
